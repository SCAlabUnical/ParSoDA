# ParSoDA
ParSoDA (Parallel Social Data Analytics) is a Java library for social media analytics

ParSoDA defines a general structure for a social data analysis application that includes a number of configurable steps and provides a predefined (but extensible) set of functions that can be used for each step. User applications based on the ParSoDA library can be run on both Apache Hadoop and Spark clusters.
The current version of the library (v. 1.3.0 dated \textbf{October 26, 2018}) contains more than forty predefined functions for implementing applications in different domains, such as: $i)$ \textit{trajectory mining}, for analyzing the mobility patterns and extracting trajectories of social media users; $ii)$ \textit{sentiment analysis}, for analyzing collective sentiments and the dynamics of public opinion; $iii)$ \textit{regions-of-interest mining}, for discovering the interesting hot spots (regions-of-interest) that reveal trajectory concentrations.
